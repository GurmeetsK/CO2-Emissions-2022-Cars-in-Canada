For the very first thing, we will check the average CO2 Emissions(in g/kg) of all cars as well as combined fuel consumption(L/100km)

SELECT avg(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`)
FROM `my2022 fuel consumption ratings`

SELECT avg(`Fuel Consumption(Comb (L/100 km))`)
FROM `my2022 fuel consumption ratings`


The result gives us 259.17 g/km and 11.1 L/100km(rounded to the nearest hundredth). What does this mean?

Essentially, each diesel or petrol car emits a certain level of grams into the atmosphere.The higher the number, the worse the impact on the environment. 
Higher numbers also generally lead to higher fuel consumption - an indicator of poor fuel economy.(taken by buyacar uk).

Next, we will check to see how the CO2 Ratings of the cars are spread out. The ratings provided by the dataset are from 1 to 10, with 1 being the worst.

SELECT `CO2 Rating`, COUNT(*)
FROM `my2022 fuel consumption ratings`
GROUP BY `CO2 Rating`

Immediately, what stands out is, though the results(attached in the repo as a Tableau chart) are parabolic in nature, 
there are more inputs towards the to the left side. Hence, there are more cars with a greater number of CO2 Emissions, than not.

The next logical step would be to ascertain how these ratings relate to the CO2 Emissions per gram and what the average is for each rating.

SELECT DISTINCT(`CO2 Rating`),
avg(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`)
from `my2022 fuel consumption ratings`
GROUP BY `CO2 Rating`
ORDER BY `CO2 Rating` asc

We notice that the averages are more far apart as the ratings get worse and the difference between ratings get better as as emissions get lower. 
This is attributable to the fact that, as stated above, there is a bigger number of cars with worse ratings than good ones.

Doing the same query for Fuel Consumption, we get similar results:

SELECT DISTINCT(`CO2 Rating`),
avg(`Fuel Consumption(Comb (L/100 km))`)
from `my2022 fuel consumption ratings`
GROUP BY `CO2 Rating`
ORDER BY `CO2 Rating` asc

Thus, proving that fuel consumption and co2 emissions are quite a hefty worry when it comes to petrol and diesel car transportation.
