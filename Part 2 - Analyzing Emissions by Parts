In our next part, we will assuage how other parts of a car can impact Co2 emissions. 

These include querying car Cylinders, Transmission, Fuel Type, Vehicle Class and Make. 

SELECT Cylinders, 
COUNT(*),
avg(`CO2 Rating`)
FROM `my2022 fuel consumption ratings`
GROUP BY Cylinders
ORDER BY avg(`CO2 Rating`) asc

Cylinders are an integral part of a car’s fuel consumption - which helps turn the fuel into energy.
Hence, it is no surprise that the more cylinders there are in the car, as the above query illustrates, the higher the emissions.

Next, we will get into the types of vehicles provided in the dataset.


SELECT `Vehicle Class`, 
COUNT(*),
avg(`CO2 Rating`)
FROM `my2022 fuel consumption ratings`
GROUP BY `Vehicle Class`
ORDER BY avg(`CO2 Rating`)as

The ranges of the averages are from 3.37 to 6.1. The best-rated vehicle class at 6.1 is Small Station Wagon, with Compact nearby at 5.8.

On the other side, Pick Up Trucks, Standard SUV, Two-seater and Mid-size Station Wagons are all below 4. 

Pick Up Trucks and SUVs also have a higher count at 113 and 141 respectively. 
In total these two types are 26.8% of the whole population of cars. In our next part we will look at if these skew the dataset.

Before that, we will look at the Make.

SELECT Make, 
COUNT(*),
avg(`CO2 Rating`)
FROM `my2022 fuel consumption ratings`
GROUP BY Make
ORDER BY avg(`CO2 Rating`) asc

We can notice that(though with a lesser sample size), the usual suspects are the ones with a lower CO2 rating, 
the Bugattis, the Lamborginis, the Bentleys, all below a average of 3 rating with Rolls Royce, with other sports cars hovering around this rating. 

In the vicinity of these sports cars, we also have Dodge, GMC and Land Rover, below the rating of 3.5. 

On the other side, with a significantly better rating(around 6), we have our Hyundais, Hondas and Kias, among other cars of the same ilk.

One more curious thing we can notice from these groups of results is that there are certain Makes(biggest example being Lexus) who’s average 
CO2 Emissions do not line up with their expected rating.

In the example of Lexus, while it has an average rating of 5.25 and average emissions of 230.1 grams. 

Buick, with a worse rating, has better average of emissions.

In a statistical sense, we can attribute this to a lack of a sample size for Buick OR we can attribute this to Lexus, and other Makes,
having a wider range of CO2 emissions in their cars. 

We will also explore this in our analyses, starting in the next part.
