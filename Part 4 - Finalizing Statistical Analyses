To begin with, if we take our Pearson Coefficient query and apply it to the Vehicle class, 
we will see that all coefficients are in the negative except for mini-compact, compact and two-seater.

To further this analysis and before we continue, we will also calculate range by vehicle class 

SELECT `Vehicle Class`,
 MIN(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`),
MAX(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`),
(MAX(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`)-MIN(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`)) as 'range'
FROM`my2022 fuel consumption ratings`
GROUP BY `Vehicle Class`


SELECT Make,
 MIN(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`),
MAX(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`),
(MAX(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`)-MIN(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`))
FROM`my2022 fuel consumption ratings`
GROUP BY Make

We can already see from our ranges that - two-seater do have the highest range, and if we look at our query for make - Bugatti and Lamborghini, 
which we have already queried to know that these are primarily two-seaters, are outliers.

For the other Makes and Vehicle Classes, take for example Toyota and HyundaI and Kia, 
these have a higher count, meaning a higher selection of vehicle classes, so their ranges are much higher.

Yet, there are only a select few makes that have consistently low co2 emissions and a lower range, 
the biggest example being MINI, MAZDA, AND MITSUBISHI.

This shows that Car companies, at least in Canada, are not incentivized to consistently create more cars with better co2 emissions.

The biggest example of this is checking the same dataset from the database for hybrid or electric cars. 
The counts for the other two datasets combined are a little more than half that of regular petrol and diesel cars.
