# CO2-Emissions-2022-Cars-in-Canada


While modern technology has solidified an era of convenience for the consumer - it has also impacted the way Earth responds. This statement holds more true for cars - one of the highest emitters of Carbon Dioxide to the atmosphere.

The world is beginning to recognize this and an enormous amount of data is being released that helps us understand just how much certain cars emit carbon dioxide.

This dataset, found on Kaggle and provided by Open Canada, will set out to explore which cars are the bigger culprits - and what about said cars makes them so.

I will also be using specific statistical analyses in SQL as well to deepen our knowledge of Carbon Dioxide emissions released by 2022 released cars in Canada


|**Parts**|**Description**|**Queries Used**|
| :------------- |:-------------| :-----|
| Part 1      |Initial Emission Analysis. I use basic queries to understand averages of fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. |(Queries used: Avg, Distinct, Count, Group by, Order by)|
| Part 2     |   I begin segregating emissions and fuel consumption by car parts and car types.   | (Queries used: Avg, Distinct, Count, Group by, Order by) |
| Part 3 |    I use statistical methods such as standard deviation, pearson coefficient and more to understand how car makes behave with each other mathematically. | (Queries used: Count,min,avg,max,stddev, group by, order by, subqueries, dense rank, partition, where)  |
| Part 4 |    I use the pearson coefficient and other found statistical analyses on vehicle class and also find  range bey vehicle class to conclude statistical analyses.     |Queries used: Min, Max, Arithmetic,  Group By)  |
| Part 5 |    I re do all queries from Part 1, while making a slight change to conclude our entire analysis and come to specific conclusions about the data and the dataset.     |(Queries used: Avg, Distinct, Count, Group by, Order by)  |
