To complete our analysis, we will rehash our analyses from Part 2 and add average CO2 Emissions to them, as well.

SELECT Cylinders, 
COUNT(*),
avg(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`)
FROM `my2022 fuel consumption ratings`
GROUP BY Cylinders
ORDER BY avg(`CO2 Rating`) asc

SELECT `Engine Size(L)`, 
COUNT(*),
avg(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`)
FROM `my2022 fuel consumption ratings`
GROUP BY `Engine Size(L)`
ORDER BY avg(`CO2 Rating`) asc

SELECT `Vehicle Class`, 
COUNT(*),
avg(`CO2 Emissions(g/km)`)
FROM `my2022 fuel consumption ratings`
GROUP BY `Vehicle Class`
ORDER BY avg(`CO2 Rating`) asc

From just these three queries, we can see a clearer picture of the carbon dioxide emissions that these categories emit.

Using CO2 Rating, while good for brief analyses and overviews, remains unclear and, sometimes, too simplistic.

If car companies use these ratings, they would be able to get away with higher emissions using simple data analysis. 
Moreover, according to research, Canada and USA do have the highest  emissions.

Hence, like in the UK, lesser emissions need to be incentivized for car companies. 
These incentives can include tax breaks for car companies, or for the car owner, taxes so they would be unwilling to use such cars, 
Thereby putting a supply chain burden on car companies who are known carbon culprits.
